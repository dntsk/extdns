# ExtDNS for docker-compose

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/dntsk/extdns)

ExtDNS synchronizes labeled records in docker-compose with DNS providers.

Inspired by [External DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns), ExtDNS makes resources discoverable via public DNS. It retrieves a list of records from Docker's labels and creates it in public DNS.

- ExtDNS uses the `/var/run/docker.sock` to query DNS records defined in container labels and then creates these records in public DNS.
- Supports custom DNS IP address in labels, such as private IP address.
- Provides an option to automatically detect public IP and use it as DNS record.
- Automatically updates DNS records when IP address changes.
- Automatically removes DNS records when containers are deleted.
- Checks for changes every 300 seconds by default.

The following table clarifies the current status of the providers according to the aforementioned stability levels:

| Provider       | Status | Maintainers |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| CloudFlare DNS | Beta   |             |

## Running ExtDNS

To run your ExtDNS you just need to spinup container with needed environment variables and set labels to your docker container.

Use `docker-compose.yml` as an example.

## Docker Label

| Label                                  | Description                                                                        |

English proofreading is needed too, because my grammar is not that great sadly. Feel free to correct my grammar in this Readme or source code.
