# ExtDNS for docker-compose

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/dntsk/extdns)

ExtDNS synchronizes labeled records in docker-compose with DNS providers. Now it supports just CloudFlare.

Inspired by [External DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns), ExtDNS makes resources discoverable via public DNS (CloudFlare). It retrieves a list of records from Docker's labels and creates it in public DNS.
